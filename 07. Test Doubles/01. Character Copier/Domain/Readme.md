# Character Copier by Urs Enzler6

The character copier is a simple class that reads characters from a source and copies them to a destination one character at a time.

When the method Copy is called on the copier then it should read characters from the source and copy them to the destination until the source returns a newline (\n).

The exercise is to implement the character copier using Test Doubles for the source and the destination (try using Spies – manually written Mocks – and Mocks written with a mocking framework).
